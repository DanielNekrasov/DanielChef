C1 - Ginger & treacle cake with ice cream

C2 - Chocolate truffle chestnut torte with honeycomb
“A decadent torte so rich you’ll only need a little slice! This recipe makes more honeycomb than you’ll need, but leftovers will store for a week in an airtight container. ”

C3 -Chocolate Guinness Cake
“With a heady mix of Guinness and chocolate, this cake is a grown-up treat. Rich and dark, the velvety bitterness of the Guinness brings out the flavour of the chocolate, so it packs a punch, while lending the sponge a subtle tang. The richness is balanced by the sweetness of the sour cream icing, which makes the cake look like the famous Irish stout – black with a creamy head. Cheers! ”

C4 - Chocolate & salted caramel cake
“You don’t use all the caramel, but it keeps in the fridge for a few days. ”

C5 - Strawberry & cream sandwich sponge
“This classic cake is, of course, named after Queen Victoria, the only monarch to reign longer than the current Queen. It’s relatively easy to make but does have a few quirks: you need to get as much air into it as possible, and be mindful of its sensitivity to variations in heat. Know your oven well and invest in an oven thermometer! ”
